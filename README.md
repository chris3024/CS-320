#### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that the code base is functional and secure by useing a couple of different testing techniques. The first that I have used is a static testing method. 
I looked over the code base looking for any obvious issues such as, missing punctuation, missing error handling, a missing security functionality. The second method 
of testing that I used was dynamic testing. In this instance, I created testing methods using the Junit 5 framework to ensure the code functioned in the way that is correct and secure.
#### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs cand be hard to distinguish because that can come from the lack of communicative skills. In other words, the user may not know how to express what 
they would like in the software package. This is where interviewing and communicating openly can accomplish great things. The more questions that can be asked 
of the user can usually draw a clearer picture of what they would like to see in the software. Also, this is where getting early concepts of the software in to 
the hands of users can pay huge dividends. The more eyes on the software and using it, allows for the development team to gather greater feedback in ways to improve upon the software. 
#### How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with an open mind. This all begins when during the requiremment gathering stage of the SDLC. To me, the more questions that I can ask of the clients, the better picture I can gather of what they are looking for in the software. After I have the requirements,
